# Blockquote && cite

As allways first I like to share this GitHub repo [web](https://ehdinayan.github.io/E04-blockquote-cite/)
Well in this repo I would like to share use of label blockquote:

It is a block element, and is used to mark entries from other authors or documents. Its specific attribute is *cite*, wich gives an url to original source:

```
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>—Aldous Huxley, <cite>Brave New World</cite></figcaption>
</figure>
```

We have used here blockquote and cite labels, as well as cite attribute to show something like this, as we get from MDN:

<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>—Aldous Huxley, <cite>Brave New World</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

For the exercise of this repo, we copied a poem and used blockquote and cite labels to point an analysis from other web source and original first publishment data respectively. We did not use cite attribute.

This explanation is ok to me.
